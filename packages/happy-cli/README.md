# Happy

Code on the go — control AI coding agents from your phone, browser, or terminal.

Free. Open source. Code anywhere.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g happy
```

> Migrated from the `happy-coder` package. Thanks to [@franciscop](https://github.com/franciscop) for donating the `happy` package name!

## Usage

### Claude Code (default)

```bash
happy
# or
happy claude
```

This will:
1. Start a Claude Code session
2. Display a QR code to connect from your mobile device or browser
3. Allow real-time session control — all communication is end-to-end encrypted
4. Start new sessions directly from your phone or web while your computer is online

### More agents

```
happy codex
happy agy        # Antigravity CLI (Gemini's successor)
happy gemini     # deprecated — use `happy agy`
happy openclaw

# or any ACP-compatible CLI
happy acp opencode
happy acp -- custom-agent --flag
```

## Daemon

The daemon is a background service that stays running on your machine. It lets you spawn and manage coding sessions remotely — from your phone or the web app — without needing an open terminal.

```bash
happy daemon start
happy daemon stop
happy daemon status
happy daemon list
```

The daemon starts automatically when you run `happy`, so you usually don't need to manage it manually.

### Keeping the daemon running across reboots

If you want the daemon to come back automatically after a reboot — without opening a `happy` session first — start it from your shell profile so it inherits your normal user session context (PATH, keychain access, OAuth credentials):

```bash
# ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
if [[ -o interactive ]] && [[ -z "$HAPPY_DAEMON_CHECKED" ]]; then
    export HAPPY_DAEMON_CHECKED=1
    () {
        local state=$HOME/.happy/daemon.state.json
        local pid=$(grep -oE '"pid"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*[0-9]+' "$state" 2>/dev/null | grep -oE '[0-9]+')
        if [[ -z "$pid" ]] || ! kill -0 "$pid" 2>/dev/null; then
            happy daemon start >/dev/null 2>&1
        fi
    } &!
fi
```

The first interactive shell after a reboot triggers the start; subsequent shells short-circuit because the daemon is already running.

> **macOS users:** prefer this shell-init approach over a `launchd` LaunchAgent. A LaunchAgent runs in an agent domain that is **detached from your GUI/Aqua login session**, which means the bundled `claude-agent-sdk` cannot reach the macOS keychain and silently fails authentication ("Failed to authenticate. API Error: 401 terminated", `duration_api_ms: 0`). If you must use launchd, your wrapper has to read the OAuth access token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` and export it as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` before exec'ing the daemon — and you'll need to handle token rotation yourself.

## Authentication

```bash
happy auth login
happy auth logout
```

Happy uses cryptographic key pairs for authentication — your private key stays on your machine. All session data is end-to-end encrypted before leaving your device.

To connect third-party agent APIs:

```bash
happy connect gemini
happy connect claude
happy connect codex
happy connect status
```
